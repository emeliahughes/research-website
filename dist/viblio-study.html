        <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this research project is to learn more about how users encounter information on YouTube and how they determine information credibility. This study will focus on testing a Chrome extension the researchers have developed. The researchers hope to gain insight on the effectiveness of the extension to help users determine whether information is credible.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Study Procedures</h2>
        <p>This study will be conducted in three distinct parts. The first part will be a usability and onboarding interview. Participants will be walked through the installation of the Chrome extension, then asked to perform tasks with the extension. Afterwards, participants will receive more information about the extension and the next part of the study. The second section of the study will be independent tasks that participants will perform over the course of five days. Each day, the participants will be asked to watch some videos and interact with the extension before filling out a daily reflection form. The final section of the study will be a debriefing interview where participants will reflect on the activities they performed with the researchers. The interviews will be recorded so that the researcher can review notes later. You will not be asked to state your name on the recording. No personal identifying information will be recorded.</p>
        <h2>Potential Risks</h2>
        <p>The risks from this study are no more than what are usually encountered in daily life, during a conversation with a colleague, or browsing the web.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of the Study</h2>
        <p>The interviews will help us identify the opportunities for improving and advancing the current tools as well as building new systems for YouTube users.</p>
        <h2>Extent of Anonymity and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Your records will be kept in locked files and only research investigators will be allowed to look at them. Your name and any other fact that might point to you will not appear when the results of this study are presented or published. Your privacy will be protected to the extent required by law. The interview transcripts, contact information, email correspondence, etc. will be linked with an anonymous ID that will be kept securely and will be destroyed after the records retention period required by state and/or federal law.</p>
        <h2>Other Information</h2>
        <p>You are free to withdraw from this study at any time without penalty. You are also free not to answer any questions that you choose during the interview</p>
